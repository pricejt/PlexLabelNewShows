# PlexLabelNewShows

With Family accounts there is a need to label new shows automatically. 
Example set up.
1 Plex pass account
  Family Setup Mom, Dad, Kid, Together 
  
Under the together account Mom and Dad watch shows. No one actually watches shows under the plex pass account because that account sees all shows. 
The plex pass user doesn't care about the shows my wife only watches or the shows my kid watches. 

In order for us to easily see new shows we would add a label to them so they show up under Together and we can decide if we want the show or who will watch it.
